### The Problem:
There is a huge amount of textual material, and it is only growing day by day.
There is a great need to reduce a large part of this data to shorter and more focused texts, which provide the important details and contain the information we are looking for.

### Solution:
We will use the auto-text summary method, which is the process of creating a shorter version of a longer document.
